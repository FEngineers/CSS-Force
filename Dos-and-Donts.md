# Name Element
We should name a element according to "What's the elememnt used to do?" instead "What's the element looks like".

For example, we can use ".warning" instead ".yellow"

# Both Class and ID are case sensitive
We recommend to use lowercase for Class and ID

For example, we can use "carousel-container" instead "carouselContainer"

# Dont add Class for every element
We can add a Class for parent element, and use cascade to control all the Children.


# Divitus: Div is not always necessary
We should use:

  <ul class="nav">
    <li>...</li>
  <ul>

instead

  <div class="nav">
    <url>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
